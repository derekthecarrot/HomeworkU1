# Horiseon SEO and Accessibility Project

## Description
I built this project in order to improve and further my skills with HTML and CSS Accessibility standards and Search Engine Optimization.
It was originally semantically incorrect and had some code that could be improved on. I learned about the proper HTML structure and was able to also consolidate some attributes on the CSS Stylesheet. Some challenges I ran into is learning when or why a div should be used versus any other element. For example: I changed a DIV element to a NAV due to the section containing Navigation links.

## Credits

I collaborated with Daniel Peterman (https://github.com/DanielPeterman) in order to code more semantically correct HTML.
I also used W3Schools for the same reason. Tutorial: (https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_layout.asp)
